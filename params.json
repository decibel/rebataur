{"name":"Rebataur","tagline":"Define your entire Data Science infrastructure using SQL","body":"### Welcome to Rebataur.\r\nRebataur is an open source project that provides SQL abstraction to big data science projects and infrastructure and internet services locally or cloud.\r\n\r\n### What is the problem with Data Science now.\r\nToday there are many meritorious projects, such has Hadoop, Spark, Pandas, R , Python and many  that can be used for data science projects. All of these programming languages or infrastructure have their strengths and limitations. For example Hadoop is highly scalable and parallel but slightly slower then Spark. Python and R language have good statistical packages but sometimes one is easier to use than others, or performance of one is better than other.\r\n\r\nAll this makes Data Science and polyglot project where you combine technologies and pipeline your data through them to achieve a sophisticated analysis of data.\r\n\r\nThis creates a challenge of installing, learning and maintaining programs in different programming languages and platform combining them repeatedly to produce the desired results in analytics. Any slight change would require multiple changes to infrastructure and programs, which will certainly cause delays and headaches.\r\n\r\n### How does Rebataur solves this.\r\nWe already know how powerful SQL is in managing data, and all big data platforms including Hadoop and Spark are moving in SQL direction. \r\n\r\nImagine you could abstract away the creation of different infrastructure on demand like Hadoop/Spark/Rlang etc, pipeline the data through them and make them work on the data and output the results finally as a standard SQL query result.\r\n\r\nRebataur project is trying to do create a single SQL interface to all data science platform and programming languages, so that you could just issue SQL statements and infrastructure and data pipeline would be created for you and you would get the results without installing, maintaining individual infrastructure in you data center or cloud.\r\n\r\nRebataur would also be able to connect to cloud services like AWS for certain analysis and retrieve data from social sites like twitter using plain simple SQL. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor more info please email on - info at rebataur dot com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
