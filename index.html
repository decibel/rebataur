<p>Rebataur is an open source project that provides SQL abstraction to big data science projects and infrastructure and internet services locally or cloud.</p>

<p>Today there are many meritorious projects, such has Hadoop, Spark, Pandas, R , Python and many  that can be used for data science projects. All of these programming languages or infrastructure have their strengths and limitations. For example Hadoop is highly scalable and parallel but slightly slower then Spark. Python and R language have good statistical packages but sometimes one is easier to use than others, or performance of one is better than other.</p>

<p>All this makes Data Science and polyglot project where you combine technologies and pipeline your data through them to achieve a sophisticated analysis of data.</p>

<p>This creates a challenge of installing, learning and maintaining programs in different programming languages and platform combining them repeatedly to produce the desired results in analytics. Any slight change would require multiple changes to infrastructure and programs, which will certainly cause delays and headaches.</p>

<a id="how-does-rebataur-solves-this" class="anchor" href="#how-does-rebataur-solves-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does Rebataur solves this.</h3>

<p>We already know how powerful SQL is in managing data, and all big data platforms including Hadoop and Spark are moving in SQL direction. </p>

<p>Imagine you could abstract away the creation of different infrastructure on demand like Hadoop/Spark/Rlang etc, pipeline the data through them and make them work on the data and output the results finally as a standard SQL query result.</p>

<p>Rebataur project is trying to do create a single SQL interface to all data science platform and programming languages, so that you could just issue SQL statements and infrastructure and data pipeline would be created for you and you would get the results without installing, maintaining individual infrastructure in you data center or cloud.</p>

<p>Rebataur would also be able to connect to cloud services like AWS for certain analysis and retrieve data from social sites like twitter using plain simple SQL. </p>
